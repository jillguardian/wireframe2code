# Wireframe2Code

Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific type, size, and placement of web page elements.
They are devoid of artistic choices like fonts, logos, colours, and the like.
Because they are easily adjustable, they are ideal for planning content placement, 
and for identifying and solving navigation and functionality problems early in the project.

When building applications, thereâ€™s a turning point where you have to start building the user interface
from your wireframe. Typically, this process is expensive, time-consuming, tedious, and repetitive.
But what if you could generate source code straight from your hand-drawn design mock-ups?
